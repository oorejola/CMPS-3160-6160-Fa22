One such package is scikit-learn, a machine learning package in Python. Machine learning will be discussed in depth in the coming Labs, and we will explore the features of scikit-learn extensively in those chapters. Because distance matrices are important in machine learning, scikit-learn provides functions for calculating distance matrices.\n","\n","For example, the following code calculates the (Euclidean) distance matrix between all of the houses in the Ames housing data set:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"9IQQ5w2O8SRm","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1666051108918,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":916,"user":{"displayName":"Oliver Orejola","userId":"04422573830718569613"}},"outputId":"fded26fd-23fd-4bed-c52c-3de36281243a"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[   0.        ,  760.00065789,  327.00038226, ...,  686.        ,\n","         267.00187265,  344.00327033],\n","       [ 760.00065789,    0.        ,  433.00144342, ...,   74.00675645,\n","         493.        , 1104.00147192],\n","       [ 327.00038226,  433.00144342,    0.        , ...,  359.00034819,\n","          60.01041576,  671.00074516],\n","       ...,\n","       [ 686.        ,   74.00675645,  359.00034819, ...,    0.        ,\n","         419.00119332, 1030.00109223],\n","       [ 267.00187265,  493.        ,   60.01041576, ...,  419.00119332,\n","           0.        ,  611.00265957],\n","       [ 344.00327033, 1104.00147192,  671.00074516, ..., 1030.00109223,\n","         611.00265957,    0.        ]])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}],"source":["from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances\n","\n","D_ = pairwise_distances(housing_df_quant, metric=\"euclidean\")\n","D_"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pf511Ccb8SRm"},"source":["Notice that the return type is a `numpy` array, instead of a `pandas` `DataFrame`.
